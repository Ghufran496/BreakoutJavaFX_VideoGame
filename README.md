## Installation

Install the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer. You can download it from the official Oracle website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/.

Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports JavaFX development, such as Eclipse, NetBeans, or IntelliJ IDEA.

Create a new JavaFX project in your IDE and add the Breakout game code to your project.

Make sure to include the necessary JavaFX libraries in your project, such as javafx.base, javafx.graphics, javafx.controls, and javafx.fxml.

Compile and run the Breakout game code in your IDE. This can be done by clicking on the "Run" button or by using the keyboard shortcut for running the program.

The Breakout game should launch in a new window, and you should be able to play it using your mouse or keyboard controls.
## Usage
You can see three buttons on this stage.
▪ Clicking on Start button will start the game.
▪ Clicking on Help button will display some instructions about game.
▪ Clicking on Close button will exit the game immediately.

Game will begin when you click on start button, move paddle to initiate the ball movement. You 
can clearly see score which is equal to the number of bricks you have broken and lives you have 
left. Player will lose life when ball will touch bottom wall.
There are several features of this project:

<h4> Color System!</h4>
We added three color balls according to requirements. 
▪ Green ball has high strength. When ball hit Green color, it will change its color to Yellow 
and when ball hits Yellow it will change its color to Red and third time when ball will hit Red 
it will be broken. Powerup system also added in this condition.
▪ Yellow color has medium strength. It will first change to Red and again if ball will hit red, it 
will be broken.
▪ Red has Low strength. It will break when ball hits one time. And Score will increment by 1.
<h4> PowerUP!</h4>
When ball will hit the green ball then paddle width will increase (bigger paddle) and when player
lose any life paddle will come to its orginal width.
